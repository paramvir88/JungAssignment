 * Create a driver class that sets up sample data and calls the achievements

 * persistence, and use any method of creating/loading sample data that you
 * are familiar with. Also, you can combine/integrate this into your unit tests
 * if you prefer – we’re just looking for you to demonstrate that the code runs
 * with your sample data.
